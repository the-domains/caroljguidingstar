Philosophy 

My goal is to guide and support people through the journey of therapy using a style that incorporates Body, Thought and Spirit, and adapts a specific variety of techniques to each person's individual needs. I have noticed through years of practicing this form of work with others, that once the inner process is begun, your creativity and your intuition is active, and awareness increases towards a healthier sense of self, as well as increasing healthier connections with others. This leads to enriching personal, intimate/romantic, or professional relationships.   
I encourage you to review my credentials below, and to read the Healing section of the site to learn more about the methodologies I use. If you feel I can be of assistance to you or your family, please contact me.

Training by Mariko Tanaka in POMR   
Mariko Tanaka Creator of POMR therapy: "Process Oriented Memory Resolution is a psychological method that helps an individual to resolve her/his trauma memories and the belief systems that were developed at the time of trauma. In so doing an individual becomes free from the past memories that prevent them from utilizing their inborn potential." POMR originated in the work and training Mariko Tanaka received with Arnold Mindell's Dream Body and Process Oriented Psychology, Brent Baum's HMR work and John and Helen Watkin's Ego State Work.

What is Process Work?   
Process work is a cross-disciplinary approach to support individual and collective change. It developed in the 1970's and 1980's when Dr. Arnold Mindell, a Jungian analyst in Zurich, Switzerland, began researching illness as a meaningful expression of the unconscious mind. Also known as Process-Oriented Psychology (POP) or Dreambody work, Process Work offers new ways of working with areas of life that are experienced as problematic or painful. Physical symptoms, relationship problems, group conflicts and social tensions, when approached with curiosity and respect, can lead to new information that is vital for personal and collective growth. With its roots in Jungian Psychology, Taoism and physics, Process Work believes that the solution to a problem is contained within the disturbance itself and provides a practical framework through which individuals, couples, families and groups can connect with greater awareness and creativity. 

Training by Brent Baum HMR Work   
Brent Baum, HMR: "The work we're doing is client centered, body centered, and the body is the key. The body seems to remember everything. So if you trust and learn how to dialogue with the body correctly, then memory access and release is fairly simple. It's not that complicated. The technique has two parts. One is simply a verbal tracking technique based on the idea that a trauma hypnotizes you. A trauma overwhelms your nervous system, either physically or emotionally, and causes your flight/fight/freeze response to react. When that system kicks in, consciousness is actually paused a millisecond prior to being overwhelmed. So every trauma essentially creates a millisecond pause of consciousness. When that occurs, it is stored as a hologram, a three-dimensional image. When that is encoded, we kind of emotionally numb out as the scene goes on. Then adrenaline hits our system. We're physically stronger. We make it through the event. But essentially we've been hypnotized by a moment of 'overwhelm.' So it's a little tricky, but you don't really need to be hypnotized. What most of us need is to be de-hypnotized. The trauma hypnotizes us and causes an automatic encoding of an altered state." 

Certification in Rapid Resolution Therapy(c) Dr. Jon Connelly   
I am excited to announce that the new certification I have received enables me to help you to a greater extent using highly specialized form of hynotherapy called "Rapid Resolution Therapy(c) ", created and taught by Dr. Jon Connelly. It zeros in on specific forms of anxiety, depression, trauma, complicated grief, and a host of other personal issues that might feel unresolvable. It can be extremely effective on its own, and blended into my continuously growing practice of counseling and psychotherapy as well for you to get what you most want out of it. Please feel free to contact me for more information on this wonderful supplemental piece to my potential sessions with you. http://www.rapidresolutiontherapy.com/
